# Palindrome-Extractor
This is a basic program that finds and extracts palindromes from a given text.

So what exactly is a palindrome? Well, a palindrome is a name, number, sentence, or other character sequence that reads the same backward as forward, such as "abba, aa, avbbva and on and on". Of course, these are all meaningless terms with no context, but better examples are the words "madam or racecar, for example."

The program is built around a regular expression, however, it does not work perfectly because it can detect just six characters, which means that it can recognize words with six letters and down to two, but not more than six.

I'll try to fix it in the future, but I don't have enough experience with regular expressions to make it more detailed.
