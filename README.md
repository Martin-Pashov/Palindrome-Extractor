# Palindrome-Extractor
This is a basic program that finds and extracts palindromes from a given text.

So what exactly is a palindrome? Well, a palindrome is a name, number, sentence, or other character sequence that reads the same backward as forward, such as "abba, aa, avbbva and on and on". Of course, these are all meaningless terms with no context, but better examples are the words "madam or racecar, for example."

The program is built around a regular expression.
